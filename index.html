            <h3>The Gateway to the World</h3>
            <p>
              In 1241, the prosperous trading city of Lübeck formed an alliance
              with Hamburg, which eventually resulted in the League of Hanseatic
              Cities. Membership of this powerful commercial and defensive
              alliance between coastal cities in Northern Europe would be
              crucial to Hamburg's economic position in the world.The
              bloodthirsty pirate Klaus Störtebeker taught Hamburg traders to
              fear him and yet became a legend in the Hanseatic city. Nowadays
              it's probably more famous for its cabaret shows, erotic art
              museums and the Red Light District, where the Beatles first made
              their first recording during the 1960s.
