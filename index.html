            <h2>Why Hamburg?</h2>
            <h3>The Gateway to the World</h3>
            <p>
              In 1241, the prosperous trading city of Lübeck formed an alliance
              with Hamburg, which eventually resulted in the League of Hanseatic
              Cities. Membership of this powerful commercial and defensive
              alliance between coastal cities in Northern Europe would be
              crucial to Hamburg's economic position in the world.The
              bloodthirsty pirate Klaus Störtebeker taught Hamburg traders to
              fear him and yet became a legend in the Hanseatic city.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nowadays it's probably more famous for its cabaret shows, erotic
              art museums and the Red Light District, where the Beatles first
              made their first recording during the 1960s. Hamburg has a
              considerable amount of parks throughout the city and because it
              rains most of the year, there is abundant green vegetation. The
              winters can be snowy, but the christmas markets and the winter DOM
              are in town to warm the temperatures.

                <p>
                  Playground coffee is sustainably and fairly produced, varied
                  and very, very tasty. From the beginning, our goal was to turn
                  a mass-produced item into a quality product that is accessible
                  to everyone and simply fun to drink.

                <p>
                  I appreciate a good coffee and people that strive to be
                  creative even on the most simple subjects. This place has
                  both!

                  The Thai restaurant serves authentic traditional street food,
                  which offers you an absolute visual and taste experience. The
                  dishes are unique and incredibly intense, but the drinks are
                  also a total highlight – so delicious!

                <p>
                  I am a sucker for asian cuisine, especially when it involves
                  fish. Add freshness, explosion of flavor and good ambiance and
                  I'm a fan!

                  The finest confectioner in the Schanzenviertel has probably
                  the tastiest and prettiest cakes in Hamburg. The bright shop
                  is always busy but it offers a welcome break from the hustle
                  and bustle.Mr. Max's team also bakes a very large part of the
                  range vegan.

                  I love this area of the city and I also love delicious
                  pastries. The fact that these are handmade and mostly vegan
                  adds the cherry on top.
